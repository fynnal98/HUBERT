# HUBERT â€“ Flight Controller  

HUBERT is a custom **flight controller software** based on the **ESP32** platform.  
Originally developed to stabilize a helicopter, the software was gradually extended with new features and could be adapted for other flying vehicles.  
However, the project was never fully completed and has since been paused. But the development provided a leraning experience for me.

- The associated helicopter was fully designed in CAD and physically built as a prototype.  
- HUBERT started as a basic control software for this helicopter.  
- Over time, new features were added to make the controller more flexible and modular. For example, an app or a Pythonqt application was createt to set parameters.
- Although the project is currently paused, the software provides a foundation for further development and integration into new aircraft ([AIR-BERT](https://github.com/fynnal98/AIR-BERT)).
